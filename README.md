# Russian-License-Plate-Blurring

Russians are famous for having some of the most entertaining DashCam footage on the internet (I encourage you to Google Search "Russian DashCam"). Unfortunately a lot of the footage contains license plates, perhaps we could help out and create a license plat blurring tool?
OpenCV comes with a Russian license plate detector .xml file that we can use like we used the face detection files (unfortunately, it does not come with license detectors for other countries!)
